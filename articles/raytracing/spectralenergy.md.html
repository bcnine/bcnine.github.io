                            **Spectral Energy**

(insert ../common.md.html here)

Spectral energy refers to how energy is distributed across different wavelengths of light. This
distribution is typically expressed as a density function, which describes the amount of energy per wavelength. Think of this like a population map for a country: the population of
the entire country is spread out over different cities and towns, each with its own population
density.
