**Deriving the Vulkan Perspective Projection Matrix**

Introduction
---

When I first switched from OpenGL to Vulkan, I used the common hack of using the negative viewport and offset to account for Vulkan's Y down. When I went to add in reverse Z functionality to my hobby renderer, it started getting messy, so I just decided to re-derive everything from scratch. Hopefully you'll find this useful.

Perspective Projection Matrix
---

Let's start with some notation. $(X_e, Y_e, Z_z)$ will be eye coordinates, $(X_c, Y_c, Z_c)$ will be clip coordinates, and $(X_p, Y_p, Z_p)$ will be projected coordinates (coordinates on the near plane).

We want to work out the 4x4 matrix that takes points in eye space to points in clip space:

$$
\newcommand{\tallest}{\left(-\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
X_e \\ Y_e \\ Z_e \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\ Y_c \\ Z_c \\ W_c
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The Intercept Theorem tells us that the ratio between a coordinate in projected space and eye space is the same for each coordinate:

$$
\frac{Y_p}{Y_e} = \frac{Z_p}{Z_e}
$$

But we know that $Z_p$ is the negated near plane, since $n$ is the near plane *distance*, and we're looking down the negative $Z$ axis. Therefore

$$
Y_p = \frac{-n}{Z_e} Y_e = \frac{1}{-Z_e} n Y_e
$$

and likewise for $X$:

$$
X_p = \frac{-n}{Z_e} X_e = \frac{1}{-Z_e} n X_e
$$

The perspective divide that happens in hardware can be used to work around the fact that when multiplying a vector by a matrix, there's no way to divide by a component. The hardware will divide $X_c, Y_c, Z_c$, and $W_c$ by $W_c$. Ok, so we know then what the clip space w component $W_c$ should be then, it's simply $-Z_e$. Why? Well note that dividing by $-Z_e$ is exactly what we want to achieve to get from eye coordinates to projected coordinates.

So now we can fill out the final row to accomplish this divide:

$$
\newcommand{\tallest}{\left(-\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  0 & 0 & -1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
X_e \\ Y_e \\ Z_e \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\ Y_c \\ Z_c \\ W_c
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC) are clip space coordinates divided by their $w$ component. This is why they're called "normalized" (similar to normalizing a vector by dividing all the coordinates by length).

$$
\newcommand{\tallest}{\left(-\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)}
\begin{bmatrix}
  X_n \\
  Y_n \\
  Z_n \\
  W_n
\end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_c/W_c \\ Y_c/W_c \\ Z_c/W_c \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The near plane of the viewing frustum is defined by the 4 points (starting from upper left and going clockwise):

$$
(l, t),
(r, t),
(r, b),
(l, b)
$$

and since Vulkan is Y down, we want an NDC mapping like so:

$$
(l, t) => (-1, -1)
$$
$$
(r, t) => (1, -1)
$$
$$
(r, b) => (1, 1)
$$
$$
(l, b) => (-1, 1)
$$

Setting up a linear system for this and solving, we get

$$
X_n = \frac{2}{r-l} X_p - \frac{r + l}{r - l}
$$
$$
Y_n = \frac{2}{b-t} Y_p - \frac{b + t}{b - t}
$$

Substituting formulas for $X_p$ and $Y_p$, we have

$$
X_n = \frac{2}{r-l} \left( \frac{n Y_e}{-Z_e} \right) - \frac{r + l}{r - l}
$$

and factoring out $1/-Z_e$, we get

$$
X_n = \frac{1}{-Z_e} \left( \frac{2n}{r-l} \right) X_e + \frac{r + l}{r - l} Z_e
$$

and same for $Y_n$

$$
Y_n = \frac{1}{-Z_e} \left( \frac{2n}{b-t} \right) Y_e + \frac{b + t}{b - t} Z_e
$$

But recall $X_c = X_n W_c$ and $Y_c = Y_n W_c$, so now we're able to fill out the first 2 rows of our eye-to-clip matrix:

$$
\newcommand{\tallest}{\frac{2n}{r-l}}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{2n}{r-l} & 0 & \frac{r+l}{r-l} & 0 \\
  0 & \frac{2n}{b-t} & \frac{b+t}{b-t} & 0 \\
  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
  0 & 0 & -1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
\vphantom { \tallest } X_e \\ \vphantom { \tallest } Y_e \\ Z_e \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\vphantom { \tallest } X_c \\ \vphantom { \tallest } Y_c \\ Z_c \\ W_c
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Ok, next, on to z. We know we want to encode z to go from 1 to 0 since we're doing reverse z. Hopefully it's clear we don't really need to use x and y values, so our third row will look something like $(0, 0, A, B)$. We just need to figure out $A$ and $B$.

We know

$$
Z_n = \frac{Z_c}{W_c} = \frac{A Z_e + B W_e}{-Z_e}
$$

But eye space always has a w component of 1, so this simplifies to

$$
Z_n = \frac{A Z_e + B}{-Z_e}
$$

So when $Z_n = 1$ we know that $Z_e$ must have been $-n$ (recall $n$ is positive). Basically, when eye z is on the near plane, $Z_n = 1$. Likewise, when $Z_n = 0$, $Z_e$ must be -far, so

$$
\frac{A(-n)+B}{-(-n)} = 1
$$

$$
\frac{A(-f)+B}{-(-f)} = 0
$$

so therefore

$$
A(-n) + B = n
$$

$$
A(-f) + B = 0
$$

and we have

$$
A = \frac{n}{f-n}
$$

$$
B = \frac{nf}{f-n}
$$

Finally, we have

$$
Z_n = \frac{1}{-Z_e} \left( \frac{n Z_e}{f-n} + \frac{nf}{f-n} \right)
$$

As before, we can see that the expression in the parentheses is equal to $Z_c$, so with that, we can finally build the complete matrix

$$
\newcommand{\tallest}{\frac{2n}{r-l}}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{2n}{r-l} & 0 & \frac{r+l}{r-l} & 0 \\
  0 & \frac{2n}{b-t} & \frac{b+t}{b-t} & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \frac{n}{f-n} & \frac{nf}{f-n} \\
  0 & 0 & -1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
\vphantom { \tallest } X_e \\ \vphantom { \tallest } Y_e \\ Z_e \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\vphantom { \tallest } X_c \\ \vphantom { \tallest } Y_c \\ Z_c \\ W_c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
