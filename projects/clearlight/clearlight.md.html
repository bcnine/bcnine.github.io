                            **Clearlight: A Software Rasterizer in WebAssembly**
                            *(We don't need no stinkin' WebGL!)*

[Try it out!]("/projects/clearlight/index.html") (The demo should work on all evergreen browsers, just give it a few seconds to load)

Nothing scratches that nostalgic itch like getting your old software running again on a modern platform. Years ago, as a budding 3D
developer, I was fascinated with the mechanics of the rasterization process in graphics. It was becoming borderline obsessive
though, so I finally built a rasterizer so that I could get some closure and move on with my life.

After going back and forth on requirements, I settled on:

- Sub-pixel correct rasterization
- Perspective correct interpolation (on all interpolated values)
- Z buffering
- Face culling
- Efficient line clipping ([Jim Blinn]("https://www.amazon.com/Jim-Blinns-Corner-Graphics-Pipeline/dp/1558603875/" target="_blank") ftw!)
- Point and directional lights (punctual lighting)
- Vertex, fragment, and triangle shaders
- Decal texturing
- Built-in shaders for flat, Gouraud, and Blinn-Phong shading models
- Cross platform

It worked great (eventually), and I stopped optimizing at around 30 fps for 100k tris (decent for 2006). The renderer was
written in C++ though, and it was a pain to compile and keep up-to-date with the dependent libraries (wxwidgets for a
display window and freeimage for loading textures).

Fast forward 12 years... we now have self driving cars, dedicated transistors for raytracing, and WebAssembly. There's probably
a few other things too, but it's mainly this. [Emscripten]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten" target="_blank"), if you're not
familiar with it, lets you compile code in C/C++/Rust to either optimized javascript (asm.js) or actual WebAssembly, which, if you
haven't heard of that, is a binary format for a stack-based virtual machine embedded in a web browser. You can now breathe new life
into those old projects and share them much more easily (no more messy platform binaries!)

To get this going, I did have to alter the framebuffer code to display to an SDL surface, instead of wxwidgets. Emscripten includes a
special version of SDL2 that converts the surface to an HTML5 canvas. If you use OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 it will even convert that to WebGL
1/2 for you! It's really nice to be able to compile the same project in either a web version (for mass consumption) or a platform-specific
binary (for stepping through in a debugger).

Emscripten actually builds a run-time environment in JavaScript that looks to the executable no different than a typical
OS environment (e.g. Unix, OS X). A single javascript file contains emulation for a file system, environment variables, memory
allocation, everything the executable needs. I just find this super impressive. Anyway, I've set things up so that the filesystem is baked
out into a data bundle, and for this project, that bundle is quite large (~30 MB), so that's the reason for the delay in the loading time.

Finally, I cleaned up the interface a bit, and now the project makes a great demo and also serves as a basic teaching tool, for
explaining things like, e.g. why it's so important to push your near plane out as far as possible, and the artifacts you may
see if you don't. Artists seem to relate to a visual demo much more readily than a theoretical aside on the limitations of
floating point (weird).

I've had these models for so long (obj + mtl / textures) that I can't find them on the web anymore, but if you recognize any of them
please shoot me an email and I'll credit you here!
